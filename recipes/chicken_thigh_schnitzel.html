        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, trimmed of fat</li>
            <li>1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>avocado oil cooking spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an air fryer to 375ÂºF. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken thighs, one at a time, between 2 sheets of 
                parchment paper and flatten with a mallet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine bread crumbs, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. 
                Place flour in a separate shallow bowl and beaten egg in a third
                shallow bowl. Dip chicken thighs first in flour, then in beaten egg.
                Finally, coat with seasoned bread crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place breaded thighs in the air fryer basket, making sure they are 
                not touching: work in batches if necessary. Mist with avocado oil 
                and cook for 6 minutes. Flip each thigh, mist with oil, and cook 
                an additional 3 to 4 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
